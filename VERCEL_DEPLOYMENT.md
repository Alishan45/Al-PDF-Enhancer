# Vercel Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

Your AI Content-to-PDF Enhancer is ready for Vercel deployment! You'll need to set up API keys for the AI models to work.

## 📋 Environment Variables (Required)

The app requires API keys to function. Set these up in your Vercel project:

### Required Environment Variables

1. **GEMINI_API_KEY** (Required)
   - Get your free API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - This is the minimum required for the app to work

### Optional Environment Variables

2. **OPENAI_API_KEY** (Optional)
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Enables GPT-4 Turbo model

3. **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** (Optional)
   - Get from: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Enables Claude 3 Sonnet model

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - **Before deploying, add environment variables:**
     - Go to "Environment Variables" section
     - Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your API key
     - Optionally add `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Click "Deploy"

## ✅ Features Available

- ✅ Gemini 2.0 Flash (Experimental)
- ✅ Gemini 1.5 Flash (Latest)

### With Additional API Keys:
- ✅ All Gemini features above

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that all files are committed to git
2. Ensure `package.json` has correct scripts
3. Verify `vercel.json` configuration

### If API calls fail:
1. The app works with built-in Gemini key
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify CORS settings (already configured)

## 📱 Usage

Once deployed:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Paste a URL or enter text
3. Select AI model (Gemini models work immediately)
4. Choose enhancement type (summarize, expand, validate)
5. Generate and download PDF

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The built-in Gemini key is safe for public use
- Your custom API keys are secure in Vercel
- No sensitive data is stored or logged
- All processing happens server-side

## 📊 Performance

- Fast loading with Next.js optimization
- Serverless functions scale automatically
- PDF generation optimized for Vercel limits
- CDN distribution for global performance
